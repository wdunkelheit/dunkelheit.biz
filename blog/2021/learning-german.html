<h2>Learning German</h2>


<p>I have decided to learn German. I have always had an interest in learning another language but due to the terrible methodology used by the education system and cringe meme apps like DuoLingo I was never motivated enough to stick them out. However I recently came to discover the Michel Thomas method after reading these articles by Luke Smith: <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/notes-on-learning-languages">Notes on Learning Languages</a> and <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/learning-european-languages-michel-thomas">Learning European Languages (Michel Thomas)</a>. I won&rsquo;t bother to sumamrize them here but you should definetely read them if you are interested in learning a language.</p>
<p>After reading these articles I was convinced to give the method a try. I will update this post every so often with my thoughts on the method so far.</p>
<h2 id="so-why-german">So why German?</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably the most relevant language for me to learn based on its similarities to English, my musical interests and the location of a lot of my friends. I would love to be able to travel there without being a &ldquo;that guy&rdquo; tourist that just speaks in English the whole time.</p>
<p>Additionally I believe that learning German will give me reason to explore other related languages. I have always found languages interesting, who knows maybe one day I will be able to speak to people on every continent? I&rsquo;d also like to put the theory that thinking in multiple languages can give you a better understanding of concepts to the test.</p>
<h3 id="update">Update:</h3>
<p>So far I am enjoying the format of the tapes but due to factors outside of my control I am unable to get very far with them at this current time. I hope to resolve this issue ASAP.</p>
