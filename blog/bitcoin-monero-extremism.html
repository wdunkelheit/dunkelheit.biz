<h2>Bitcoin and Monero Extremism</h2>

<p>I am a Bitcoin maximalist but I am also a Monero extremist. These positions aren&rsquo;t mutually exclusive. In fact these two technologies combined solve the problems of the other.</p>
<h3 id="digital-cash-digital-gold">Digital Cash, Digital Gold</h3>
<p>It seems almost inevitable at this point that Bitcoin will overtake Gold as the strongest (in terms of market cap) store of wealth. Bitcoin is the new gold standard üòâ for storing wealth but it&rsquo;s not very good at being money any more (just like gold). Due to high transaction fees and currency speculation it is better to not use your Bitcoin and to just HODL.</p>
<p>Although there are emergent technologies trying to solve this problem like the lightning network there are some issues regarding anonymity and privacy that makes traditional cash superior for transacting.</p>
<p>This is where Monero comes in. Being the only cryptocurrency that allows for transactions to be both anonymous and private, Monero functions almost exactly like physical cash does, except digitally and without out of control money printing.</p>
<p>Monero can be swapped for Bitcoin using decentralised platforms too meaning you do not require the traditional finance system to acquire it. There is also the experimental technology of atomic swaps that allows from private chain-to-chain transactions to swap one crypto for another.</p>
<p>For these reasons Bitcoin and Monero are the only cryptocurrencies that have legitimate use cases as currency.</p>
<h3 id="utility-tokens">Utility Tokens</h3>
<p>There are some other cryptocurrencies that aren&rsquo;t shitcoins but these are mostly utility tokens such as the Brave foundation&rsquo;s BAT (Basic Attention Token) and Namecoin. But as utility tokens these function as a means to an end and not as a form of savings or money.</p>
<h3 id="proof-of-stake---proof-of-shitcoin">Proof of stake - Proof of shitcoin</h3>
<p>Any cryptocurrency that uses a proof of stake model is a shitcoin. The model is unworkable on its own and the people in charge of these shitcoin projects know this. Which is why they will either never actually implement proof of stake or if they do it will be some kind of utility contract on top of proof of work.</p>
<p>Every DEFI project that is trying to be or surpass Bitcoin is a shitcoin. By trying to be Bitcoin they are proving that they cannot improve upon it. By trying to do more than Bitcoin they are creating a monolith with complexity issues that will drag it down. See Ethereum gas prices for an example of this.</p>
<h3 id="nfts">NFTs</h3>
<p>Shitcoins taken to their logical conclusion. Lol</p>
<h3 id="muh-power-usage">Muh power usage</h3>
<p>Like most energy alarmism this is a non-issue. If you understand how electric power is generated and how much of it goes to waste due to fluctuations in demand then you will see that Bitcoin actually incentivises energy innovation and prevents waste.</p>
<p>In fact this is demonstrated in real life Bitcoin mining practices. Countries with cheap electricity get more Bitcoin mining operations in them which brings more money into the local economy as well as incentivising said means of creating energy. El Salvador plans to mine Bitcoin using geothermal for example.</p>
<p>A great way to explain how Bitcoin mining reduces waste is that miners seeking the highest return on their investment will go where the energy is cheapest and most abundant, leaving the places were it is more costly and limited. This effectively allows for excess energy production in one part of the world to be utilised elsewhere by proxy.</p>
<h3 id="getting-friends-into-crypto">Getting friends into crypto</h3>
<p>I recommend Bitcoin to people looking for a way to store their money and protect it from inflation, I also recommend it as its price goes up nicely year on year (mostly).</p>
<p>Monero is harder to recommend to people as most people that get into crypto just want gains and don&rsquo;t see the point in using it as money when they can use money. I understand this position and why it is held, which is why I generally only recommend Monero to people that are already internet present.</p>
<p>That is not to say however that I won&rsquo;t recommend it to people anyway, just that if they have no real use for it then they will be better off just buying some sats instead.</p>
<p>In fact one thing that Monero is excellent for is teaching someone the basics of how cryptocurrencies work with real life examples but without breaking the bank. It is also good at giving people an idea of how other cryptocurrencies aren&rsquo;t private or anonymous.</p>
