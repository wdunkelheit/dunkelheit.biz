      <description>I have decided to learn German. I have always had an interest in learning another language but due to the terrible methodology used by the education system and cringe meme apps like DuoLingo I was never motivated enough to stick them out. However I recently came to discover the Michel Thomas method after reading these articles by Luke Smith: Notes on Learning Languages and Learning European Languages (Michel Thomas). I won&amp;rsquo;t bother to summarize them here but you should definitely read them if you are interested in learning a language.</description>
